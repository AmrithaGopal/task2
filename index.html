                            Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, near
                            Eastbourne in East Sussex, on the northern edge of
                            the South Downs. It consists of an inner circuit of
                            ditch and bank, incomplete where it meets a steep
                            slope on its north side, and the remains of an outer
                            circuit. Causewayed enclosures were built in England
                            from shortly before 3700 BC until at least 3500 BC;
                            their purpose is not known. The enclosure has been
                            excavated twice: in 1949, by Reginald Musson; and in
                            1962, by Veronica Seton-Williams, who used it as a
                            training opportunity for volunteers. Charcoal
                            fragments from Musson's dig were later dated to
                            between 3500 and 3300 BC. Musson also found a large
                            quantity of Ebbsfleet ware pottery in one of the
                            ditches. Seton-Williams found three polished stone
                            axes deposited in another ditch, perhaps not long
                            after it had been dug. The site is only 800 metres
                            (870 yd) from Butts Brow, another Neolithic
                            enclosure; both sites may have seen Neolithic
                            activity at the same time.
